This A/D converter has 24 bit resolution with noise of approximately 70 ÂµV, which determines the noise level of our current and voltage readings: the TED CTs are rated for 200 amp circuits and a maximum of 3 volts, so we are able to differentiate between currents of approximately ((200))(70 Ã— 10âˆ’6)/(3) = 4.66mA, corresponding to power changes of about 0.5 watts. Similarly, since we use a 1:100 voltage stepdown in the oscilloscope probe, we can detect voltage differences of about 7mV.\"\n",
